                Today's youth make the future of our nation.. They have the bubbling enthusiasm which if regulated and utilized the right way, can lead the nation to the zenith.. They are the ones who embody the future of the nation.. Therefore, if we want to ensure a bright future of our country, we first need to strengthen and empower our youth.. However, it is worth to note that the hectic lifestyles of teens and loss of apetitte does affect their physical as well as mental well being.. Too often, they get caught up in the hustle and bustle of life, trying to fulfill their dreams, follow their passion and build their career.. Not to mention, the students living in the hostels, away from their home, to fulfill their career goals are deprived of nutrients in the food they eat.. They crave for a healthy meal enriched with nutrients.. They yearn to relish their every meal with a blend of nutrients.. After all, the goal of any person is to "live to the fullest" and make the best of himself which can happen only when he is healthy.. Therefore, WE aim at fulfilling the nutritional requirements of students living in the hostels by helping them pave their way towards a healthy appetite.. Our motto is simple: Eat right, stay bright.. To make it simple, we let the teens enjoy the taste of eating right and let a healthy future begin now!
